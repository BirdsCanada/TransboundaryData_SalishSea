# Additional Data Resources {#ADD9}

Dataset were excluded from individual summaries if they were determined
to be out of scope for one or more of the following reasons:

(1) The data are suitable for our assessment but are not yet available
    to the public.

(2) The primary focus was on pelagic seabirds, not seaducks. These
    datasets were also often collected outside the Salish Sea (our study
    area).

(3) The dataset was historical, meaning it was not readily accessible
    and/or lacked the necessary metadata.

(4) The surveys were narrowly scoped and species-specific.

## Canadian Pacific Vessel-Based Survey {#ADD9.1}

In 2020, Environment and Climate Change Canada - Canadian Wildlife
Service (ECCC-CWS) started vessel-based line transect surveys to collect
quantitative baseline data on pelagic seabirds (not necessarily focused
on seaducks). These data are being collected to provide a fundamental
resource for mapping the abundance and distribution of birds at sea.
Surveys are to continue through 2024, after which the data should be
made publicly available. The main contact for this dataset is
[Caroline.Fox\@ec.gc.ca](mailto:Caroline.Fox@ec.gc.ca){.email}

## Pelagic Seabird Atlas {#ADD9.2}

The [Atlas of Pelagic
Seabirds](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/18306535-8604-4c0c-9cc6-299a8a5ea318)
off the West Coast of Canada presents maps that display the distribution
of 48 species of seabirds. The rationale for developing this atlas was
the recognized need for a product that could assist with: coastal zone
and conservation area planning; emergency response to environmental
emergencies; and identification of areas of potential interactions
between seabirds and anthropogenic activities. In addition, the data
used to develop the document provides a baseline to compare with future
seabird distributions in order to measure the impacts of shifts in
composition, abundance and/or distribution of prey, and climatic and
oceanographic changes.

Seabird surveys were conducted aboard commercial and Canadian federal
government 'ships-of-opportunity' from 1982-1983 and 1991-2005 within
the study area (45° N to 58° N and from the coast to 148° W). The
average densities within 5'latitude by 5' longitude grid cells are
displayed seasonally. These data may be used to generate
presence/absence and trends in and estimates of relative abundance.
These data can also be used to examine patterns in temporal and spatial
distribution. However, due to the opportunistic nature of the surveys,
both in space and time, these data should not be used to determine
absolute abundance.

## North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database (NPPSD) {#ADD9.3}

The
[NPPSD](https://www.usgs.gov/data/north-pacific-pelagic-seabird-database-nppsd)
was created in 2005 to consolidate data on the oceanic distribution of
marine bird species in the North Pacific. Most of these data were
collected using at-sea strip-transect surveys within defined areas and
at known locations. The NPPSD also contains observations of other bird
species and marine mammals. The original NPPSD combined data from 465
surveys conducted between 1973 and 2002, primarily in waters adjacent to
Alaska. These surveys included 61,195 sample transects with location,
environment, and metadata information, and the data were organized in a
flat-file format. It contains observations of 20,098,635 birds and
365,227 marine mammals.

The NPPSD database and is available on the USGS Alaska Science Center
NPPSD web site. Supplementary materials include an updated set of
standardized taxonomic codes, reference maps that show the spatial and
temporal distribution of the survey efforts and a downloadable query
tool.

All survey metadata can be found
[here](https://alaska.usgs.gov/data/metadata/ecosystems/nppsd/NPPSD_metadata.html).

## Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team (COASST) {#ADD9.4}

Established in 1999, The [COASST](https://coasst.org/) is a citizen
science project housed at the University of Washington and focused on
the beach environment of the northeast Pacific. Over 4,500 participants
on more than 450 beaches spanning four states have contributed directly
to monitoring their local marine resources and ecosystem health. Data
collection happens on the outer Pacific Coast, not within the Salish
Sea.

## Regional Population Monitoring of the Marbled Murrelet (WDFW) {#ADD9.5}

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife monitors populations of
Marble Murrelets. This monitoring plan is specifically designed to
estimate marbled murrelet density, population size, and population trend
in each of five geographic areas (conservation zones) between the
northern tip of Washington state and San Francisco, California. Within
each zone, the offshore boundary denoting the extent of the target
population is defined. Observers in small boats followed a prescribed
at-sea transect line and recorded perpendicular distances to all
murrelets observed from mid-May to the end of July when murrelets
detected on the water are most likely locally breeding birds. Distance
sampling methods are used to compute density and population estimates
for the target population each year.

Details on the program and reports can be found
[here](https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/species/brachyramphus-marmoratus#resources).

## Cherry Point Aquatic and Fidalgo Bay Aquatic Reserve shore-based monitoring (DNR - WA) {#ADD9.6}

This study used shore-based marine bird point counts to determine
current abundance and evaluate long-term changesin abundance of several
marine bird species within the Washington Department of Natural
Resources' Cherry Point Aquatic Reserve (CPAR) and Fidalgo Bay Aquatic
Reserve (FBAR). This project originated at the CPAR in 2013 and began as
a pilot project using the same protocols at Fidalgo Bay in 2017.
Continued monitoring will allow statistical tests for better determining
the abundance trends of marine birds in the CPAR and FBAR.

-   Six aerial surveys of waterbirds were conducted on the west coast of
    Vancouver Island during the spring of 1999 andwinnerinter of 2000.
    Abundance was estimated in 274 pre-determined shoreline-based
    transects, each associated with a unique marine ecological unit
    (eco-unit).

-   The replicated surveys of individual shoreline transects were
    processed to determine: 1) distribution and abundance of waterbirds
    on the near-shore portion of the west coast of Vancouver Island, 2)
    waterbird densities across marine ecological units and 3) seasonal
    variability in waterbird distribution and abundance

    from 1953 until at least 1976.

-   US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has conducted aerial surveys of
    marine birds in Grays Harbor and at 64 sites in Puget Sound. These
    surveys occurred irregularly in various months and years, with
    surveys conducted in Padilla Bay from October to March of 1977--1986
    (22 surveys). These data were compiled by M.J. McMinn and W.H.
    Schaff of the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge.

-   Marine Ecosystems Analysis (MESA) Puget Sound surveys were conducted
    one to three times per month from January 1978 to December 1979 in
    the Strait of Juan de Fuca and northern Puget Sound (see Wahl et al.
    1981).

-   Both summer and winter aerial surveys were conducted each year
    between 1992 and 1999. These surveys sampled the entire marine
    shoreline of greater Puget Sound by two strata between 1993 and
    1997: nearshore (\< 20 meters [m]) and offshore (\> 20 m). They
    annually covered 13% to 15% of the nearshore and 3% to 5% of the
    offshore marine waters in Puget Sound up to the Canadian border and
    out to the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

-   Comparable to the nearly identical winter aerial transects conducted
    during both 1978-79 MESA\
    and 1992-99 PSAMP efforts.

-   Conducted from 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1979 in the Strait of
    Juan de Fuca north to the San Juan Islands and Point Roberts and
    west to Sidney, British Columbia. Major objectives were to determine
    the time of occurrence, distribution, abundance, and locations of
    important concentrations of marine birds. Data were obtained on
    breeding marine birds on 99 geographic units in American waters.
