## Overview

Previous research has identified a suite of biophysical predictors
important in predicting the distribution and habitat use of sea ducks
and coastal birds (Table 1). However, likely owing to the international
border dividing the Salish Sea, many of these environmental/biophysical
layers have yet to be compiled or used for trans-boundary habitat
modeling. Furthermore, there are numerous available data sets that have
yet to be tested in predicting the distribution of sea ducks that could
be important (Table 2). The purpose of this chapter is to give an
overview of spatial data that can support international sea duck habitat
models in the Salish Sea. At the end of this chapter the user will know:

1.  What spatial data is available for modeling in the Salish Sea

2.  Where to get the data

3.  The limitations of the data (e.g., spatial resolution and temporal
    scale)

4.  How to work with different types of data

## Available Data

Below you will find a collection of available data sets that could be
used in sea duck habitat suitability analysis. The data sets provided
here have been guided by previous literature and may not be
comprehensive. When available newer or better data sets have been
included to replace out of date sources. Some covariates in Table 1 have
been excluded as they are specific to the research being conducted
(latitude/longitude, autocorrelation, and effort). A suite of data sets
that have not been previously tested have also been included here. Not
all of these data sets are trans boundary in nature but have been
included for special use cases and could be updated if and when a
corresponding data set becomes available.

### Net Primary Productivity

Net Primary Productivity (NPP), the measure of energy or biomass
accumulation by primary producers, influences the distribution of
consumers at greater trophic levels. With the launch of ocean-observing
satellites, reasonable estimates of ocean primary production have become
available. Numerous models exist for determining NPP, however, the
vertical general productive model (VGPM) is a common standard and is a
function of chlorophyll, available light, and photosynthetic efficiency
(O'Malley 2012). Alternatively, the concentration chlorophyll-*a* has
been used as an index of NPP as it related to phytoplankton biomass
(Moses et al. 2009).

#### Data Use Considerations

Both datasets are freely available to download and use from their
respective links in the table above. User sign up might be required.

The VGPM has a few flaws that might limit its usability for habitat
suitability modeling. Firstly, its resolution of approximately 10km by
10km is a bit coarse. Furthermore, the model is limited to calculations
south of 49^o^ N in December and 53^o^ N in January. With the northern
most point of the Salish Sea Bio-region being at 50.8^o^ N the VGPM
would not cover the full extent of the study area of interest.

Chlorophyll-*a* data from MODIS on the other hand comes with better
resolution and timescale, however, this comes at a cost of file size and
the number of files which can be cumbersome to deal with. Furthermore,
even though the data set has a daily temporal scale, cloud cover can
lead to missing data. To overcome this issue one could use MODIS Level 3
data that provides averages at 8-days or monthly at a resolution of 4 km
which could be problematic depending on the time scale you might be
interested in.

### Sea Surface Temperature

Sea Surface Temperature (SST), can also influence the distribution of
species based on their thermal needs (Lamb et al. 2020; Zipkins et al.
2010).

#### Data Use Considerations

MODIS, Pathfinder, and MUR-SST data are freely accessible to download at
their respective links above. MODIS data comes in a higher resolution
but might be more cumbersome to work with given there are two satellite
passes per day resulting in large file downloads. Pathfinder data is
ready to use immediately and has day and night averages. Furthermore,
like Chlorophyll-*a* data from MODIS, daily data can often be incomplete
depending on cloud cover in the region of interest on a given day. An
alternative would be to use MODIS level 3 data which averages over 8 day
or monthly periods but at the cost of a lower resolution of 4km.

MUR-SST data from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive
Center is possibly a good solution to overcome the problems with the
first two data sources. This data set uses data from multiple sensors
that have been calibrated with each other to provide SST data that is
consistant in time and space. This allows for high spatial resolution
without data-voids due to cloud contamination.

### Salinity

Salinity has been shown to influence sea duck distribution. Lamb et al.
(2020) found that during the winter 4 species of sea duck selected
positively for salinity.

#### Data Sources

| Dataset                                                             | Format       | Unit   | Resolution (km^2^) | Timescale           | Source                 |

#### Data Use Considerations

The SMAP Salinity V5.0 provides global coverage of sea surface salinity
at a temporal scale of 8 days and at scales of 40km or 70km resulting in
very poor spatial resolution (1600 km^2^ and 4900 km^2^ respectively).
Furthermore, the 70km product is considered the official product and is
based on smoothing of the 40 km product which can be noisy. Given this
it would be very difficult to use this layer in a meaningful way to
model sea duck habitat usage in the Salish Sea.

### Distance to Nearest Shoreline

Lamb et al. (2020) identified distance to nearest shore as a predictor
in sea duck distribution during winter, however, this differed among
species. This covariate was included along with bottom slope and depth
as a proxy for fine-scale variation in things like currents and eddies.

#### Data Sources

#### Data Use Considerations

Both data sets are freely available for download at their respective
links in the above table. Word Vector Shoreline (WVS) data is in the
form of land polygons whereas the Prototype Global Shoreline (PGS) data
comes in the form of lines. The PGS data is based on 2000 Landsat
imagery (\~30m resolution) which is finer than the WVS which at it's
finest scale is about \~2.5km. Both data sets are old with newer imagery
only being used to fill in gaps.

### Bottom Depth (Bathymetry) and Ocean Floor Topography (Slope)

Bottom depth and topography have been shown to influence sea duck
distribution likely due to a number of factors. Mostly because these
species rely heavily on benthic organisms, such as mollusks, sea ducks
will prefer shallower areas for foraging where they can reach the sea
floor that is supportive of prey populations (Lamb et al. 2020; Zipkins
et al. 2010). Bottom depth and topography may also act as proxies for
finer scale processes such as currents and eddies (Lamb et al. 2020).

#### Data Use Considerations

All data sets are freely available for download using their respective
links above. Ocean floor topography can be calculated using bathymetry
and guidelines on how to do this will be covered in the data use guide
below.

Both the US Coastal Relief Model and the Canadian Hydrographic Service
data are included for completeness, however, these data sets are not
trans-boundary in nature and are at different spatial scales which
limits their use for trans-boundary sea duck modeling.

ETOPO2 bathymetry data is a global data set at a resolution of 15
Arc-Seconds (\~450m) which would be a suitable solution to using
different data sets from the US and Canada. Another alternative which is
specific to the Salish Sea Bioregion is bathymetry data from Western
Washington University's Salish Sea Atlas. This data set was compiled
using two different data sets from the US and Canada and is at a finer
resolution than ETOPO2 data (3 Arc-seconds or \~90m). This data set is
only suitable to use for work done within the Salish Sea Bioregion as
the raster has been clipped to that boundary.

### Climate

Climatic variables such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index
has been shown to influence the distribution of wintering sea ducks
(Zipkins et al. 2010). The NAO index is related to the climatic
variability and has been shown to affect the marine environment and
ultimately ecological processes in plants and animals. Positive values
are associated with more winter storms of greater intensity. More
specific to the pacific region is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)
which will be included here as it pertains to the Salish Sea. Rickbeil
et al. (2014) found weak support for atmospheric variables (temperature
and precipitation) predicting occurrence, however, these are included
below for reference.

#### Data Use Considerations

All data sets are freely available using their respective links above.
The PDO provides a single monthly index for the Pacific Ocean. ClimateNA
on the other hand allows you to extract many monthly, seasonal, and
annual climate variables (e.g Mean Temperature and Precipitation) from
free point locations. This includes historical and future predicted
values. The data can be accessed using the ClimateNA software, API, or R
package. The major limitation to both of these data sources is that the
finest temporal resolution is down to a given month.

### Shore-zone

Rickbeil et al. (2014) found that including more detailed shore-zone
data from the Physical shore-zone mapping system for British Columbia
provided modest improvements over only using remotely sensed
environmental data for modeling the distributions of coastal bird
species in BC.

#### Data Use Considerations

Shore-zone mapping of both British Columbia and Washington was both done
during the late 1990s using a comparable methodology based on Howes
(1994). At the time of writing this the British Columbia shore-zone data
is difficult to access and work with. Many links to download the data
are broken leaving the only available data to be accessed via WMS or
.kml. WMS is image based which makes extracting the data extremely
difficult and the .kml option has known issues. Alternatively, the
Washington data is easy to access in the form of a geodatabase at the
link in the above table. Both data sets should be able to be used
together (when available) but one important thing to note is that given
their age they may not be representative of today's shore zone.

#### Data Use Considerations

Both Canada and the US have data on sea vessel routes within the Salish
Sea. The Canadian Vessel Traffic Routes data set contains information on
ferry routes, mandatory direction of traffic flow, separation lines and
zones. To be able to use this data in modeling sea duck distribution one
would have to do a bit of research to understand what all of the
different layers mean using the [Canadian Chart 1 Symbols, Abbreviations
and
Terms](https://www.charts.gc.ca/publications/chart1-carte1/sections/m-tracks/tracks-eng.html#section).
This is not as simple as using the Shipping Fairways, Lanes, and Zones
for US waters which clearly shows shipping lanes in Washington.
Washington State ferry routes have been included as they are not shown
in the Shipping Fairway data set.

The AIS Vessel Transit counts is an interesting data set that is
primarily meant to be US but also spans into the Canadian side of the
Salish Sea. This data set is a summary of each time a vessel track
passes through a 100m grid cell. Ultimately showing areas of high or low
traffic. Furthermore this can be broken down by vessel type: All, Cargo,
Fishing, Passenger, Pleasure/Sailing, Tanker, and Tug/Tow.

#### Data Use Considerations

The nearshore bottom patches data set for the Pacific Coast of Canada
provides continuous substrate map to a depth of 50m off the coast of BC.
Substrate is a key indicator of habitat in this important ecosystem
where data collection is challenging and expensive. Horizontal accuracy
of this data ranges from meters to 10s of meters due to source data and
data processing. Areas with higher data density are likely to be more
accurate. Unfortunately, at this time there does not seem to be an
analogous product for the southern Salish Sea. Habitat mapping has been
done here but only in select locations that does not cover the entirety
of the southern Salish Sea (see
[here](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ds935)).

#### Data Use Considerations

Aquaculture locations in British Columbia and Washington portions of the
Salish Sea are both available from their respective links above. Data
from Washington are provided in a spatial point layer whereas BC data is
provided in a tabular format which contains latitude and longitude
coordinates which can easily be converted to a spatial point layer as
well. Both data sets simply provide spatial locations of aquaculture
locations with the BC data set differing slightly as it includes other
aquaculture locations in addition to shellfish. Only current locations
of license holders are shown which do not appear to include historical
locations.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada provides a yearly Herring Spawn Index for
approximately 300
[sections](https://pacgis01.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/FGPPublic/Pacific_Herring_Spawn_Index_Data/Pacific_Herring_Section_Maps.pdf)
along the coast of British Columbia. This is a relative index of Herring
Spawn biomass. There is currently no analogous data set for the United
States, however, actual biomass has been estimated by the Washington
Department of Fish and Wildlife for the Puget Sound. Furthermore, for
the same region there is a data set of spawning habitat although survey
dates go as far back as 1969 and may not be representative today and
there does not appear to be an equivalent data set for BC.

#### Data Use Considerations

The British Columbia Marine Conservation Analysis provides a suite of
data on the aquatic vegetation in British Columbia's coastal waters.
Available data includes information on Kelp, Surfgrass, Ditch Grass, and
Eelgrass. Data sets vary and contain multiple sources per species (e.g.
Eelgrass polygons, Priority Eelgrass Habitat, and Eelgrass Biobands).
Metadata for each of these different data sets can be found
[here](https://bcmca.ca/datafiles/individualfiles/bcmca_eco_vascplants_eelgrass_polygons_metadata.htm).

A predicted data set representing polygons of Eelgrass for the BC Coast
is available from the Hakai Institute. Currently data is not directly
downloadable, however, a data request can be made to data\@hakai.org.
This data set uses coastline ShoreZone and bathymetry data to predict
Eelgrass extent. More information can be found using the link in the
above table.

The Washington State ShoreZone Inventory contains data on aquatic
vegetation for Washington state. Data from this survey is old coming
from aerial video collected in 1994-2000. Information on Eelgrass,
Dunegrass, Surfgrass, and Kelp is available in a linear format
indication areas of continuous or patchy presence along the shore.

The Washington Marine Vegetation Atlas provides spatial information on
the vegetation that grows in nearshore areas for the southern Salish
Sea. This data set consists of 2000 polygon areas that have been
surveyed from 2 to 56 times and the presence or absence of different
vegetation is reported (Seagrass, Kelp, and Macroalgae). Because this
data only tells you presence absence information on abundance is not
provided. Data is not easily downloadable, however, it can be queried or
downloaded using R or GIS software. Below you will find instructions on
accessing the data using R.

### Additional Data Sources

Below is a table with a list of additional data sources not covered
above which may or may not be useful in modeling sea duck distribution
in the Salish Sea. Each source contains a link where you can download
and discover additional data and notes are provided to give an overview
of what is available.

## Working With Different Data Sets in R

Working with multiple types of geospatial data sets like the ones
mentioned above can be quite challenging especially if the user does not
have access or a great understanding of software like ArcGIS/QGIS.
Furthermore, doing any analysis using GIS software can be difficult to
reproduce. R as a GIS tool has advanced considerably in the last 10
years and has the added benefit of being flexible, reproducible, and
open source. In addition, many ecologists rely on R for statistical
analysis of their data which makes a strong argument for using R for an
entire analysis (data extraction, manipulation, and analysis). Here we
will go over some useful ways to interact and extract data from the
various types of data sets mentioned above to provide the user with a
starting point for their analysis.

### Getting Started

To get started there are a number of useful packages worth mentioning
that will be used in the following examples. Depending on the user's
skill set some of these packages may be familiar or completely new.

1.  The `sf` package provides [simple
    feature](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) access in R. This package
    works best for working with spatial data (point, line, polygon,
    multipolygon etc) associated with tabular attributes (e.g
    shapefiles). You may be familiar with the `sp` package that has
    similar functionality in a different format, however, this package
    is heading for retirement by the end of 2023 and does not support
    integration with `tidyverse` which is very popular among data
    scientists in R.
2.  The `terra` package is essentially a modern version of the `raster`
    package but faster and more flexible. Furthermore, the `raster`
    package currently relies on packages that are being depreciated
    along with `sp` at the end of the year.

Download and then load the required packages:

```{r echo = T, results = 'hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
### Install Packages
#devtools::install_github('rstudio/leaflet') ### Use development version
#install.packages("leaflet.extras")
#install.packages("leaflet.providers")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("sf")
#install.packages("terra")
#install.packages("geojsonsf")
#install.packages("exactextractr")

### Load required packages
require(leaflet)
require(leaflet.extras)
require(leaflet.providers)
require(tidyverse)
require(sf)
require(terra)
require(geojsonsf)


```

For the purpose of this tutorial we will focus specifically on data
within the Salish Sea ecoregion. A copy of the shapefile can be
downloaded from the [Salish Sea
Atlas](https://wp.wwu.edu/salishseaatlas/data/) or can simply be read
into R using the `geojsonsf` package which allows for reading in spatial
data directly from the web in geojson format. You can view an
interactive map of the boundary using the `leaflet` and supporting
packages. At time of writing this the CRAN version of `leaflet` was not
working with the `terra` package. If you encounter this problem please
download and use the development version
`devtools::install_github('rstudio/leaflet')`.

```{r echo = T, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
### Read in Salish Sea Boundary from arcgis service
SalishSeaBoundary<-geojson_sf("https://services.arcgis.com/qboYD3ru0louQq4F/arcgis/rest/services/Salish_Sea_Bioregion_Boundary/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson") %>% st_transform(4326)

### View interactive map of boundary
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(data=SalishSeaBoundary,color = "black", weight = 2, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0.5, fillColor = "darkgreen") %>% addFullscreenControl() %>%
  addLegend(colors = c("darkgreen"),labels = c("Salish Sea Bioregion"),position = "bottomright")

```

We are also going to need some pretend survey points for which we will
use to extract spatial covariates. Imagine this data set is the location
and abundance of Black Scoters during a given winter survey. We can read
in the data and have a look at it here:

```{r echo = T, warning=FALSE}
### Read in Salish Sea Boundary from arcgis service
BLSC <- read_sf("Data\\Points\\POINT.shp")

### View interactive map of boundary
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Abundance: ",as.character(Abundance))) %>% addFullscreenControl()


```

We might also want to summarize our survey area into a spatial grid
rather than individual points for the purpose of modeling and
predicting. This can easily be done using the `sf` package. To do this
we need to make sure to we are using a coordinate system that is in the
units we want. To make a 1km grid we can convert to UTM Zone 10 (26910)
before creating the grid. We convert back to WGS84 simply for viewing on
the map.

```{r}
### Transform to UTM 10 make grid 1km in size and convert to spatial dataframe
grid <- BLSC %>% st_transform(26910) %>% st_make_grid(1000, what = "polygons", square = FALSE) %>% st_sf() %>% st_transform(4326)


### View newly created grid
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(data=grid,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0) %>%
  addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Abundance: ",as.character(Abundance))) %>% addFullscreenControl()

```

Now that we have some starting data to play with we can begin to extract
spatial covariates for them.

### Working with NetCDF (.nc) Covariates

Many of the data sets mentioned above come in netCDF format which is a
very widely used format for storing and sharing scientific array data
including raster data. To download data from some of the sources above
you may need a set of coordinates to refine your search. This can be
done using `sf` package to calculate the bounding box this can be done
on your study area (SalishSeaBoundary) or based on the data you have
(BLSC).
[Here](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplMURSST41.graph?analysed_sst%5B(2022-12-13T09:00:00Z)%5D%5B(46.59306):(50.86204)%5D%5B(-125.92876):(-120.65461)%5D&.draw=surface&.vars=longitude%7Clatitude%7Canalysed_sst&.colorBar=%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C&.bgColor=0xffccccff)
is a link as an example of downloading MUR SST within the Salish Sea
Ecoregion boundary.

```{r}
st_bbox(SalishSeaBoundary)
st_bbox(BLSC)
```

NetCDF data can be read using the `terra` package and easily visualized
using leaflet. For exploration purposes the code below also includes a
toggle to add the BLSC points and the grid we created.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

### Read in Data NetCDF
SST <- terra::rast("Data\\jplMURSST41_862f_217f_f62b.nc")

### Set colour scale
pal <- colorNumeric(c("#0C2C84", "#41B6C4", "#FFFFCC"), values(SST),
  na.color = "transparent")

### Plot the data to view
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(SST, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8, group = "SST") %>% addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(SST), title = "Average Surface temp") %>% addPolygons(data=grid,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0, group = "Grid") %>% addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Abundance: ",as.character(Abundance)), group = "BLSC") %>% addFullscreenControl() %>% addLayersControl(
    overlayGroups = c("SST", "Grid","BLSC"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  ) %>% hideGroup("Grid")

```

Next we will want to extract these covariates and add them to our
respective data sets. This can be done using the `terra` package and the
`extract()` function. Points will just get the value attributed to them
whereas polygons will require some sort of function to account for
multiple raster values being within them. Typically for this scenario
using the mean is appropriate.

```{r warning=F}
### Do extraction for survey data
BLSC <- extract(SST,BLSC,bind=T) %>% st_as_sf()
grid <- extract(SST,grid,fun="mean",bind=T) %>% st_as_sf()

### See added column with data
head(BLSC)
head(grid)
```

### Working with Raster Covariates

Raster data sets are another popular spatial format one comes across
when working with spatial covariates. Typically these come in geoTiff
format but other formats are supported such as Band Interleaved by Line
(BIL), SAGA, ENVI, & others. Just like NetCDF, geoTiff rasters are read
into R the same way. For the purpose of this tutorial we will use the
[Bathymetry](https://salish-sea-atlas-data-wwu.hub.arcgis.com/maps/f23310e286614728a823ae84ab865cc1/about)
(bottom depth) raster compiled and supplied by the Salish Sea Atlas.

```{r}
### Read in raster bathymetry and project to plot on leaflet map
Depth <- terra::rast("Data\\SS_Bathymetry\\SS_Bathymetry.tif") 

```

You can see what this raster file looks like below which was generated
using the same leaflet code as we used for SST above. If using `leaflet`
for plotting spatial data you may notice some irregularities due to
different projections so sometimes you will have to project your data to
WGS84 for visualization purposes like done below. For analysis purposes
this projection may not be the best.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
### Set colour scale
pal <- colorNumeric(c("#0C2C84", "#41B6C4", "#FFFFCC"), values(Depth),
  na.color = "transparent")

Depth_projected <- Depth %>% project("epsg:4326")

### Plot the data to view
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
 addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(Depth_projected, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8, group = "Depth") %>% addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(Depth_projected), title = "Depth") %>% addPolygons(data=grid,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0, group = "Grid") %>% addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Abundance: ",as.character(Abundance)), group = "BLSC") %>% addFullscreenControl() %>% addLayersControl(
    overlayGroups = c("Depth", "Grid","BLSC"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  ) %>% hideGroup("Grid")
```

Raster data can often be quite large and difficult to work with. The
best way to go about this problem is to crop the raster to the extent of
your study. This can easily be done using the `crop()` function from the
`terra` package. We will use our grid we created to crop this raster.
You can see in the map below that the data has been cropped according to
the study area.

```{r}

### crop raster to study area must be same crs
Depth_Crop <- terra::crop(Depth,grid %>% st_transform(crs(Depth)))

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#### Plot raster
Depth_Crop_pro <- Depth_Crop %>% project("epsg:4326")
pal <- colorNumeric(c("#0C2C84", "#41B6C4", "#FFFFCC"), values(Depth_Crop),
  na.color = "transparent")

### Plot the data to view
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(Depth_Crop_pro, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8, group = "Depth") %>% addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(Depth_Crop_pro), title = "Depth") %>% addPolygons(data=grid,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0, group = "Grid") %>% addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Abundance: ",as.character(Abundance)), group = "BLSC") %>% addFullscreenControl() %>% addLayersControl(

```

Much like SST we can get a set of values for our survey points and grid.
You will notice a few transformations happening below. This is to make
sure that the projection of our points and grids match the projection of
the raster layer before being converted back to WGS84.

```{r warning=F}
### Do extraction for survey data
BLSC <- extract(Depth_Crop,BLSC %>% st_transform(crs(Depth_Crop)),bind=T) %>% st_as_sf() %>% st_transform(4326)
grid <- extract(Depth_Crop,grid %>% st_transform(crs(Depth_Crop)),fun="mean",bind=T) %>% st_as_sf() %>% st_transform(4326)

### See added column with data
head(BLSC)
head(grid)
```

Bottom slope can also easily be calculated in R using the `terrain()`
function within the `terra` package. You can read more about this
function and the alternative metrics that can be calulated from terrain
rasters [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/terra/man/terrain.html).

```{r}
Slope <- terrain(Depth_Crop, v="slope", neighbors=8, unit="degrees")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#### Plot raster
Slope_pro <- Slope %>% project("epsg:4326")
pal <- colorNumeric(c("#0C2C84", "#41B6C4", "#FFFFCC"), values(Slope_pro),
  na.color = "transparent")

### Plot the data to view
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(Slope_pro, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8, group = "Slope") %>% addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(Slope_pro), title = "Slope") %>% addPolygons(data=grid,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0, group = "Grid") %>% addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Abundance: ",as.character(Abundance)), group = "BLSC") %>% addFullscreenControl() %>% addLayersControl(
    overlayGroups = c("Slope", "Grid","BLSC"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  ) %>% hideGroup("Grid")

```

Slope values can then be extracted for our survey data just like did for
depth. One important thing to note is that since we are working with
slope which is in degrees the mean must be calculated differently. A
function for doing so is provided below. Unfortunately, this function
can't be used within the `extract()` function so averages have to be
calculated manually for each grid polygon by extracting all slope values
and averaging them using the custom function.

```{r warning=F}
####
mean_angle <- function(a, angle=c("degree", "radians")) {
  angle=angle[1]
  deg2rad <- function(x) { x * pi/180} 
  rad2deg <- function(x) { x * 180/pi }
  deg2vec <- function(x, ang = c("degree", "radians")) { 
    if(ang == "degree") {
      a <- c(sin(deg2rad(x)), cos(deg2rad(x)))
    } else if(ang == "radians") {
      a <- c(sin(x), cos(x))
    }
    return(a)
  }
  vec2deg <- function(x) {
    res <- rad2deg(atan2(x[1], x[2]))
      if (res < 0) { res <- 360 + res }
    return(res)
  }
  mean_vec <- function(x) {
    y <- lapply(x, deg2vec, ang=angle)
    Reduce(`+`, y)/length(y)
  }
  return( vec2deg(mean_vec(a)) ) 
}
### Do extraction for survey data
BLSC <- extract(Slope,BLSC %>% st_transform(crs(Slope)),bind=T) %>% st_as_sf() %>% st_transform(4326)
### Average slope more complicated must do this manually 
grid <-grid %>% mutate(AverageSlope=NA)
for (i in 1:nrow(grid)) {
  gridvalues <- extract(Slope,vect(grid[i,] %>% st_transform(crs(Slope)))) 
if(!all(is.na(gridvalues$slope))){
 grid$AverageSlope[i] <-  mean_angle(na.omit(gridvalues$slope))} else {
   grid$AverageSlope[i] <- NA
 }
  
}
 

### See added column with data
head(BLSC)
head(grid)

```

The raster tools outlined above will also work for other raster layers
such as the [AIS Vessel Transit
Counts](https://marinecadastre.gov/data/) data.

### Working with Linear Covariates

There are a number of linear covariates mentioned above that also
require a bit of data manipulation or calculation in order to be useful.
Specifically distance to nearest shoreline. Using the [Prototype Global
Shoreline Data](https://dnc.nga.mil/dncp/DNC/PrototypeGSD.php) mentioned
above I will outline how a user would go about calculating this for both
our BLSC points and our grids. You will need to download data for the
appropriate region (region 26 in this case) and because it covers a
larger area than needed lets clip it to the extent of the Salish Sea
Bioregion. This can be done using the `st_intersection()` function from
`sf`. Note that columns from both are normally included but I have just
kept the columns from the original shoreline data.

```{r warning=F}
### Read in shoreline data using sf
Shoreline <- read_sf("Data\\shapefile26\\cd26.shp") %>% st_transform(4326)

### Clip shoreline data to just salish sea to make it smaller and only keep original columns
Shoreline <- st_intersection(Shoreline,SalishSeaBoundary) %>% select(names(Shoreline))

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(data=Shoreline,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0, group = "Shoreline") %>%
  addPolygons(data=grid,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0, group = "Grid") %>% addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Abundance: ",as.character(Abundance)), group = "BLSC") %>% addFullscreenControl() %>% addLayersControl(
    overlayGroups = c("Shoreline", "Grid","BLSC"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  ) %>% hideGroup("Grid")
```

Calculating the distance to nearest shoreline is probably more
complicated than it needs to be but I will explain the steps. Because
this data set comes as a bunch of linear features compared to a single
line for shoreline we first need to subset the segments that are closest
to each of our BLSC points. This can be done using the
`st_nearest_feature()` function which basically gives us the index of
the nearest feature for each point (some might be duplicated but that is
okay). The next step is to get the nearest points between each pair of
BLSC point and shoreline segment using the `st_nearest_points()`
function. We can then at the same time calculate the distance between
these two points using the `st_length()` function.

```{r }
### Get nearest shoreline features for each point - should be 20
nearest <- Shoreline %>% slice(st_nearest_feature(BLSC,Shoreline))

### Get distance in meters and make sure it is numeric
distance <- as.numeric(st_length(st_nearest_points(BLSC, nearest, pairwise = T)))

### Add distance to BLSC data
BLSC <- BLSC %>% mutate(DistanceToShore=distance)

```

Click on the points below to see their calculated distance to nearest
shore. Use the added measurement tool on the map to test out the
calculations (some variation will be expected).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  fitBounds(as.numeric(st_bbox(BLSC)$xmin),as.numeric(st_bbox(BLSC)$ymin),as.numeric(st_bbox(BLSC)$xmax),as.numeric(st_bbox(BLSC)$ymax)) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(data=Shoreline,color = "black", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 1,opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0, group = "Shoreline") %>% addMarkers(data = BLSC,popup = ~paste0("Distance: ",as.character(round(DistanceToShore))," m"), group = "BLSC") %>% addFullscreenControl() %>% addMeasure(primaryLengthUnit = "meters")
```

This process would also work for nearest distance to a ferry lane or
other linear feature. As for calculations for the grid we created this
can also be done easily and it would be recommended to do so to the
centroid of each grid using the `st_centroid()` function.

```{r warning=FALSE}
nearest <- Shoreline %>% slice(st_nearest_feature(st_centroid(grid),Shoreline))

### Get distance in meters and make sure it is numeric
distance <- as.numeric(st_length(st_nearest_points(st_centroid(grid), nearest, pairwise = T)))

### Add distance to BLSC data
grid <- grid %>% mutate(DistanceToShore=distance)
```

Extracting values from other linear features would work very much the
same way. For example, shoreline inventory data with information on
shoreline type, one could extract information from that layer based on
the nearest feature. I will give a quick example of how to do this using
the shoreline data. Lets extract the ID of each shoreline segment. This
could easily be any field such as shoreline type etc.

```{r warning=FALSE}
### Get nearest segment for each BLSC point
nearest <- Shoreline %>% slice(st_nearest_feature(BLSC,Shoreline))

### Get just the ID
ShorelineID <- nearest %>% pull(ID)

### Add the ID to the BLSC data
BLSC <- BLSC %>% mutate(ShorelineID=ShorelineID)

```

### Climate Data

Various climate data variables can be obtained using the `ClimateNAr`
package. This package is not on CRAN so you will have to
[register](https://register.climatena.ca/) for ClimateBC/NA and download
and install the package as per there instructions. You can use this
[map](https://climatena.ca/mapVersion) to get the different types of
inputs needed for getting climate variables for the specific period you
want. Below is an example of how you could go about downloading seasonal
climate variables for the BLSC data assuming this data was for the year
2022.

```{r eval = FALSE}
### Create column to store average winter temperature. This can be one or more of the values you are interested in. 
BLSC <- BLSC %>% mutate(Tave_wt=NA)

### Loop through each point and extract climate temp

for (i in 1:nrow(BLSC)) {
  ### extract coordinates for each point
  coords <- st_coordinates(BLSC[i,]) %>% as.data.frame() 
  ### Query climate NA for seasonal data for the year 2022
  climate_vars <- ClimateNA_API(ClimateBC_NA='NA', c(coords$Y,coords$X,0), period='Year_2022.ann', MSY='S')
  ### Populate value for that point. Can also do more than one value at a time.
  BLSC$Tave_wt[i] <- climate_vars$Tave_wt
}




```

### Other Spatial Data

There are many different types of data sets one might come across that
may even be outside the ones listed here or gone over in more detail
above. However, many of the tools mentioned above will still apply. For
instance, instead of calculating the nearest distance to shore the same
could be done on point data such as BC Aquaculture sites or distance to
Eelgrass etc. Not all use cases have been explored here as there are
endless ways to work with this type of data. Below are some additional
resources that can be helpful for understanding spatial analysis in R.
